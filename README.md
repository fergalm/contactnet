An address book that helps you track connections between contacts


A normal address book gives you the details about a person.
But finding a person is next near impossible if you've forgotten their name.
I frequently forget peoples' names, so I need a way to job my memory. 
Frequently I remember relationships "that's so-and-so's brother", or "he was at that wedding". I need a way to search for people by groups or relationships. 

Contact solves that problem. In addition to names, you can add relationships and tags, then walk through the graph of people you know 'til you find the ones you've forgotten.
